In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating your very own video summarizer using a free Huggingface BART transformer model and streamlit.

Video summarization is an essential technique that extracts key information from videos, saving time and effort. We'll be using Python and a Huggingface BART encoder-decoder model with the pipeline class. By the end of this video, you'll have a working free video summarizer that you can use to generate concise summaries from any video you feed it. Join us and unlock the potential of video summarization with Huggingface!

The model I used was "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6"" but you can choose whichever you suits you best from huggingface.co
